# TypeScript Foundations

### Prerequisites

- Node.js version 20.16.0 or higher
- npm version 10.8.1 or higher

To view the current version of Node.js and npm installed on your system, run the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

> I recommend installing Node.js and npm using [nvm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager).
